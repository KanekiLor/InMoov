# 🤖 InMoov Robotic Hand

![InMoov Hand](https://github.com/KanekiLor/InMoov/blob/main/Media/1.jpg)

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a **robotic hand** based on **InMoov**, an open-source humanoid robot. The right hand (from the elbow to the fingers) was built using **6 MG996-R servomotors** and **3D-printed parts**. The fingers are connected to the servos with **PLA wires**, allowing for realistic movements. The motion is controlled via an **Arduino**.

📌 **Current Status:**  
✅ 3D printing completed  
✅ Assembled servos and structure  
✅ Basic movement tests successful  
🔄 Further improvements and additional programming in progress

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Arduino** – for servo control  
- **C++** – to program movement logic  
- **MG996-R Servomotors** – 6 motors for finger/wrist movement  
- **3D Printing (PLA)** – printed all necessary parts  
- **PLA Wires** – used to connect fingers to servos
